More importantly, all employee-related information (employee ID, name, job, department, accrual period, grade, and business unit) is also missing (NULL). This indicates a problem with how the absence plan was recorded or integrated into the system. Specifically, the system doesn't know which employee this absence balance belongs to. Further investigation is needed to identify the correct employee and absence plan to associate with this balance."
